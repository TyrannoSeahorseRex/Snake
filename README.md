# Simple Snake Game üêç  

This is a classic **Snake Game** built using Python, created as my **first-ever coding project in 2022**. It‚Äôs a fun and straightforward game where the player controls a growing snake, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions.  

## Features  

- **Classic Gameplay**: Eat food to grow longer while avoiding the walls and yourself.  
- **Simple Controls**: Use arrow keys (or WASD) to navigate the snake.  
- **Basic but Fun**: A great way to learn game logic and Python fundamentals.  

## Getting Started  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```  

2. **Run the game:**  
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```  

## How to Play  

- Use **arrow keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí) or WASD** to control the snake.  
- Eat the food to grow longer.  
- Avoid crashing into the walls or yourself!  
- Try to get the highest score possible.  

## Why I Made This  

This was my **first-ever coding project**, created back in **2022**. It was a fun way to learn Python, and it sparked my interest in development. While simple, it was a huge milestone for me in my coding journey!  

## Future Enhancements  

- Add difficulty levels (speed increases over time).  
- Implement a scoring system with a leaderboard.  
- Introduce different game modes for variety.
